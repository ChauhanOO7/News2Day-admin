# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# How to start with News2Day-admin application in your local machine:

# 1. Clone the Git Repository:
   Clone the Git repository containing the React application code to your local machine. Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL:
   
   git clone https://github.com/ChauhanOO7/News2Day-admin.git

# 2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
Change into the directory of the cloned repository:

cd project-directory

Replace project-directory with the name of the project directory.

# 3. Install Dependencies:
Once you're in the project directory, install the project dependencies using npm or yarn.

Run:  npm install
or  yarn install

# 4.  Start the Development Server:
After installing the dependencies, start the development server to run the React application.

Use:
npm start
   or
yarn start

This command will start the development server and open your React app in your default web browser.
